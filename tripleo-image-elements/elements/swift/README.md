Common element for swift elements

Configuration
-------------
swift:
    devices: r1z<zone number>-192.0.2.6:%PORT%/d1
      - A comma separated list of swift storage devices to place in the ring
        file. 
      - This MUST be present in order for o-r-c to successfully complete.
    zones:
      - Servers are divided amongst separate zones if the swift.zones
        metadata is greater than the default of 1.  Servers are placed in zones
        depending on their rank in the scaled-out list of Swift servers in the
        yaml template used to build the overcloud stack.  The scaleout rank N
        is: SwiftStorage|controller<N>.  The appropriate zone is calculated as:
        zone = N % swift.zones + 1.
      - To enable this calculation, the devices data takes the form of:
          r1z%<controller or SwiftStorage><N>%-192.0.2.6:%PORT%/d1
    hash: randomstring
      - A hash used to salt paths on storage hosts
