Install RabbitMQ server package and optionally configure it using Heat
metadata.

Heat
----

We will create a random password and feed it to a Heat wait condition
if directed by Metadata. The relevant Metadata would look something like
this in Heat:

    Metadata:
      rabbit:
        users:
          guest:
            username: guest
            tags: administrator
          nova:
            username: nova
            password: SuperSecret
            tags: 
              - administrator
              - monitoring
            permissions:
              conf: .*
              write: .*
              read: .*
        password_handle: {Ref: RabbitMQPasswordHandle}
        keepalive_disabled: true/false
        - Enable/Disable TCP keepalive on rabbitmq sockets (default is
        for keepalive to be enabled).

Using cfn-signal, we will feed back a generated password into the handle
for use by other resources.


RabbitMQ Cluster
----------------

Additional parameters in heat template are required for each clustered node:

    Metadata:
      rabbit:
        cookie: some_cookie
          - make sure same cookie is set for all nodes in cluster
        nodes:
          node0,node1

'rabbit.nodes' contains short hostnames of all nodes in RabbitMq cluster.

If a node has 'rabbit.nodes' set to true, this node is added into
cluster with other nodes listed in 'rabbit.nodes'.

RabbitMQ inter-node communication is restricted to port 5535 only in config file
(otherwise random ports would be used) to make sure this port can be enabled in
firewall.


Sample 2-node cluster definition:

    node0:
      rabbit:
        cookie: some_cookie
        nodes:
          Fn::Join:
          - ','
          - - Fn::Select:
              - name
              - Fn::GetAtt:
                - node0
                - show
            - Fn::Select:
              - name
              - Fn::GetAtt:
                - node1
                - show

    node1:
      rabbit:
        cookie: some_cookie
        nodes:
          Fn::Join:
          - ','
          - - Fn::Select:
              - name
              - Fn::GetAtt:
                - node0
                - show
            - Fn::Select:
              - name
              - Fn::GetAtt:
                - node1
                - show
