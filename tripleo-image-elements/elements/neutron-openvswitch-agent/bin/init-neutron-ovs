# Idempotent script to apply heat configuration to the running network
# environment.
#
# If a public_interface_raw_device is defined in metadata and public_interface
# does not exist, the public_interface is used to derived a vlan id and a vlan
# interface is configured.
#
# If a bootstrap public_interface_ip is defined in metadata and not attached to
# any device then it will be added to the public_interface device if one is
# defined.
#
# An integration bridge for neutron-ovs-agent is created.
#
# If no physical bridge is defined in metadata, the script will have no
# further effect.
#
# If a physical bridge is defined then ensure-bridge is called to set it up.
#
# Note that no persistent config file is written to the OS : ovs-vsctl modifies
# a persistent database so the bridge device will persist across reboots, but
# [on Ubuntu at least] early boot does not bring up ovs-vswitch early enough,
# and metadata access will fail.
