# FIXME: To avoid conflict between the pyOpenSSL installed via python-pip
# and pyOpenSSL installed via yum, we are going to sort it out installing
# it earlier at the beginning of the image building process. Pyhton-pip
# is installing pyOpenSSL as part of satisfying the requirements.txt
# in python-glanceclient and afterwards yum tries to install it as a
# dependency of the python-paste package needed for the heat element,
# this seems to be conflicting and causing the image building process to
# fail. The problem is hapenning on a Fedora 18 system.
